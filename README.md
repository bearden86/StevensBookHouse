# StevensBookHouse
Block 7A Workshop

Overview
Your friend Steven knows you are learning to code and has asked you to create an online bookstore application for his small business. He has requested the following:

A summary of five different books. You can use the following Lorem Ipsum text instead of developing actual book summaries:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

A feedback form for users
Photos for each book
Before beginning, select five books and write a summary for each.

Requirements: 
Incorporate the major HTML semantic tags.
Each of the five books should be in some "div".
Use a separate div for each book's information.
The main header text needs to be in a different color.
Create variables for text color, text size, and border using SCSS. 
Use different SCSS functionalities for styling all the elements.
Use a footer that contains the feedback link and scroll to the top link.
Provide a label and image for each of the five books. 
Include a hyperlink for each book that redirects to the specific book summary. 
A hyperlinked feedback form (you can link to a fake form or create one using Google Forms or other survey platforms).
